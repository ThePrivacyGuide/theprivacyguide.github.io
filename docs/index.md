# The Privacy Guide

Welcome to The Privacy Guide. This website aims at helping you choose privacy respecting, free and open source software and hardware for your personal life. In a world where everything and anything is connected to the internet, constantly harvesting data about our personal lives, it is more important than ever to take a step back and make better and more informed decisions about what programs and devices we use and how we use them. This guide is supposed to be for the everyday user, wanting to have a more control about what data is gathered but not wanting to sacrifice every convenience.


## Why you should care about Privacy

When I try to explain to people why for example I don't use Whatsapp or Instgram, they always say the same thing: "Well, I have nothing to hide, so I don't care if companies know what I talk about with my friends". I think this is a very dangerous way of thinking. To put it in Edward Snowden's word: "Saying you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide, is like saying you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say". I fully agree with this statement. Just because you have nothign to hide, doesn't mean you are not entitled to keep your personal data to yourself. A good analogy I find is the one of the curtains. Most people are not doing anything illegal in their homes, still most have curtains to create a private space where they can be themselves and can feel at home. I think the same applies to the internet and to techology.

If you are still thinking that you don't care about privacy, think about the bigger picture. Sadly, there are people in the world whos survival depends on wether they can communicate privatly or not. Think about Journalists, Activists, Whistleblowers and the like living in countries with oppressive regimes. The more poeple use privacy respecting technologies, the more "normal" it becomes and the less these people who really really need it will stand out when they use these techonologies. So just because you don't have anything to hide, doesn't mean somebody else doesn't.


## Starting somewhere

You might feel overwhelmed if you think about all the things you could change and you might feel like you alone won't make a difference. But rest asure that is not the case. Every little bit counts and we are going to start small and step by step you are going to gain more freedom and detach yourself from companies harvesting your data for money. Remember, Privacy is a process and not a destination which is why this Guide will never be completly finished. This is a work in progress so come back here once in a while to see the last updates.
